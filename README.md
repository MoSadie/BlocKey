# BlocKey

## What is this mod?
This mod allows users and servers to disable certain keybindings while playing.

## How to use
Players / Server Owners:
After installing the mod, use the `/bk` command to enable/disable keybindings. (Note: If used on the server side, the mod must also be installed client side.)
For example: `/bk disable inventory MoSadie` would disable MoSadie's inventory key.
