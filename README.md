# StopDrop

## What is this mod?
It's a very simple mod that disables the drop key.
You can turn it on or off with chat commands.

## How to use
After installing the mod, every time you launch Minecraft, your drop key won't work.
After joining a world, type `.sddisable` and `.sdenable` in chat to disable / enable the blocking of your drop key.
You can check if it's currently enabled by typing `.sdstatus`.
